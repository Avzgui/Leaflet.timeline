Leaflet.timeline
================

Display arbitrary GeoJSON on a map with a timeline slider and play button.

Other, similar projects exist ([LeafletPlayback](https://github.com/hallahan/LeafletPlayback)
and [LeafletSlider](https://github.com/dwilhelm89/LeafletSlider) are two) and are probably
more robust for their use case, but they only deal with markers. This handles any GeoJSON you
throw at it.
